      <p class="about-text">
        This project aims to overcome one of the toughest problems faced during
        the pandemic i.e the supply and proper management of resources
        especially oxygen cylinders and ventilators. The second wave is a grim
        reminder that how the lack of a proper management system can result in
        loss of countless lives, and that was one of the motivations for this
        project.
